# DCGAN Implementation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for image generation.

## Overview

The DCGAN is a type of GAN that uses convolutional and transposed convolutional layers in the discriminator and generator networks, respectively. This architecture has been shown to be effective for generating high-quality images.

The code in this repository trains a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset, which contains images of celebrity faces. The trained generator network can then be used to generate new, realistic-looking face images.
